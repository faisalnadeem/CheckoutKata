## Problem Synopsis
A supermarket requires a working checkout. MVP is to scan products and periodically ask for a total price, considering any special offers that apply to the product.

## Items:
|SKU	|Unit Price|  Age Limit|
|-|-|-|
|A99	|0.50||
|B15	|0.30||
|C40	|0.60||
|D20	|0.40|  16|

## Special Offers:
|SKU	|Quantity	|Offer Price
|-|-|-|
|A99	|3			|1.30
|B15	|2			|0.45

The checkout accepts items scanned in any order, so that if we scan a pack of Biscuits (B15), an apple (A99) and another pack of biscuits, weâ€™ll recognise two packs of biscuits and apply the discount of 2 for 45. Prove your solution works for this scenario.
